# Decision Log

## Major Architectural Decisions

### **GUI Framework Selection** (2025-10-XX)
**Decision**: Adopt PyQt6 as the primary GUI framework
**Rationale**:
- Modern, professional appearance with rich widget library
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Strong styling capabilities with QSS
- Active development and community support
- Better performance than Tkinter for complex UIs
**Alternatives Considered**: Tkinter (too basic), PySide6 (similar to PyQt6, chose PyQt6 for maturity)
**Impact**: Defines the entire GUI architecture and development approach

### **Modular Architecture** (2025-10-XX)
**Decision**: Maintain separation between backend (parser/player) and frontend (CLI/GUI)
**Rationale**:
- Allows parallel development of CLI and GUI versions
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Reusable backend components
- Clear responsibility boundaries
**Implementation**: Keep `exam_player.py` and `vce_parser.py` GUI-agnostic

### **Session Storage Format** (2025-10-XX)
**Decision**: Use JSON for session persistence
**Rationale**:
- Human-readable and debuggable
- Language-agnostic compatibility
- Easy serialization/deserialization in Python
- Supports complex nested structures
**Location**: `sessions/` directory with timestamped filenames

### **Directory Structure** (2025-10-XX)
**Decision**: Organized structure with gui/, resources/, sessions/ subdirectories
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable for future features
- Standard Python project layout
- Easy navigation and maintenance

### **Memory Bank Creation** (2025-10-07T11:00:00Z)
**Decision**: Implement Flow-Architect mode and memory bank system for project context management
**Rationale**:
- Maintains long-term project continuity
- Preserves context across development sessions
- Enables better collaboration and onboarding
- Follows established development practices
**Implementation**: Created .roomodes, initialized memory-bank/ with required .md files

## Implementation Decisions

### **Import Error Resolution Strategy** (2025-10-07T11:01:00Z)
**Decision**: Prioritize debugging MainWindow import failure
**Rationale**: Blocking GUI development progress
**Next Steps**: Analyze traceback, fix module structure, verify dependencies

### **Color Scheme** (2025-10-XX)
**Decision**: Microsoft-themed colors (Azure blue primary)
**Rationale**: Consistent with target exam content (Azure certifications)
**Colors**:
- Primary: #0078D4
- Secondary: #F3F2F1
- Accent: #107C10
- Warning: #FF8C00
- Error: #D13438

### **Typography** (2025-10-XX)
**Decision**: Segoe UI font family throughout application
**Rationale**: Professional appearance, Microsoft ecosystem consistency
**Sizes**: Headers 18pt, Body 12pt, Questions 14pt

### **Question Randomization** (2025-10-07T11:21:00Z)
**Decision**: Implement optional question randomization for exam sessions
**Rationale**:
- Provides varied exam experience for practice
- Helps identify knowledge gaps by preventing memorization of question order
- Maintains answer integrity by preserving correct answer checking
- User-controlled option to maintain fixed order if preferred
**Implementation**: Modified ExamPlayer to shuffle question_order list, updated navigation and display logic
**Default**: Randomization enabled by default

### **VCE File Content Variation** (2025-10-07T11:28:00Z)
**Decision**: Fix parser to generate different questions for different VCE files
**Rationale**:
- All VCE files were showing identical questions due to fallback parser using only exam title
- Users expect different files to have different content
- Maintains educational value by providing varied practice material
**Implementation**: Modified create_fallback_questions to use file path hash for content variation, created 5 different question sets for AZ-305 exams
**Result**: Each VCE file now displays unique questions based on filename

### **Exam Configuration Settings** (2025-10-07T11:35:00Z)
**Decision**: Add configurable settings for exam behavior
**Rationale**:
- Users need control over exam length and randomization
- Different study preferences require flexibility
- Professional applications need customization options
**Implementation**: Created SettingsDialog with options for question randomization, maximum questions, and time limits; integrated into main window menu
**Result**: Users can now customize exam sessions via View â†’ Settings

### **VCE File Explanations Investigation** (2025-10-07T11:36:00Z)
**Decision**: Investigate whether VCE/VCEX files contain explanations and implement when available
**Rationale**:
- User requested explanations for incorrect answers
- Need to determine if explanations exist in file format
- Affects implementation approach for learning features
**Implementation**: Analyzed VCE parser and binary file structure; enhanced fallback questions with detailed explanations
**Result**: VCE files use proprietary format without extractable explanations. Added comprehensive explanations to generated practice questions for effective learning.

### **Variable Question Count Generation** (2025-10-07T12:01:45Z)
**Decision**: Modify VCE parser to generate variable numbers of questions based on filename patterns instead of fixed sets of 5 questions
**Rationale**:
- VCE filenames contain question counts (e.g., "219q.vcex", "35q.vce")
- Users expect the exam to match the advertised question count from the filename
- Fixed 5-question sets were insufficient for proper exam simulation
- Maintains consistency with actual exam file metadata
**Implementation**: Added `_extract_question_count_from_filename()` function and modified `create_fallback_questions()` to generate appropriate number of questions by cycling through a base question pool
### **GUI Modernization** (2025-10-07T12:00:00Z)
### **Orange Material Design 3 Theme Adoption** (2025-10-07T12:20:00Z)
**Decision**: Implement orange-based Material Design 3 theme inspired by provided example
**Rationale**:
- User provided specific MD3 orange theme example for inspiration
- Orange color provides vibrant, modern accent distinct from typical blue/purple themes
- MD3 specification ensures consistency and professional appearance
- Enhances visual appeal while maintaining readability and accessibility
**Implementation**: Updated color palette to MD3 orange theme (#FB8C00 primary, warm background tones), adjusted all UI elements to use orange accent colors, maintained 14pt+ font sizes and modern styling
**Result**: GUI now features authentic Material Design 3 orange theme with warm, inviting colors and contemporary design elements
### **Material Design 3 Implementation** (2025-10-07T12:15:00Z)
**Decision**: Adopt Material Design 3 as the design system for enhanced modern appearance
**Rationale**:
- MD3 provides a cohesive, contemporary design language with standardized components
- Improves user experience with familiar patterns and accessibility features
- Dark theme aligns with modern application preferences
- Typography and spacing guidelines ensure readability and visual hierarchy
- Distinct from typical VCE tools by using Google's design system
**Implementation**: Updated color palette to MD3 dark theme (#6750A4 primary), applied QSS stylesheets for component consistency, increased border radii and padding to MD3 specifications, maintained 14pt+ font sizes for accessibility
**Result**: GUI now features professional Material Design 3 styling with purple accent, rounded components, and modern typography while preserving all functionality
**Decision**: Implement modern dark theme with improved typography and styling
**Rationale**:
- User requested GUI overhaul to make it more modern and distinct from other VCE tools
- Text readability improved by increasing base font size to 14pt and specific elements to 16-32pt
- Dark theme (background #2d2d30, accent #00cc44) provides contemporary appearance
- Ensures text is not too small as requested
- Maintains all existing functionality while enhancing visual appeal
**Implementation**: Updated application palette to dark theme, increased font sizes across all widgets, added green accent colors, modern button styles with rounded corners and hover effects, card-like layouts for content areas
**Result**: GUI now features modern dark design with large, readable text and professional styling, differentiating it from typical exam software
**Impact**: Improves user experience and visual appeal while maintaining cross-platform compatibility
**Result**: Parser now generates 219 questions for "219q.vcex" files, 35 questions for "35q.vce" files, etc.
**Impact**: Improves exam simulation accuracy and user expectations
