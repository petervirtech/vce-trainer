Questions: 5

Question 1: What is the primary purpose of Azure Resource Manager templates?
A. To deploy and manage Azure resources as a group
B. To handle user authentication only
C. To provide cloud storage solutions
D. To manage virtual networks exclusively
Correct: A
Explanation: Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates are JSON files that define the infrastructure and configuration for your project. They allow you to deploy, update, or delete all the resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation. This declarative approach ensures consistent and repeatable deployments.

Question 2: Which Azure service provides a managed Kubernetes service?
A. Azure Container Instances
B. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
C. Azure Functions
D. Azure Logic Apps
Correct: B
Explanation: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed container orchestration service that simplifies Kubernetes deployment, scaling, and operations. It provides a fully managed Kubernetes control plane, automated upgrades, self-healing, and easy scaling, allowing developers to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management.

Question 3: What is Azure Load Balancer used for?
A. Distributing traffic across multiple servers
B. Storing data in the cloud
C. Managing user identities
D. Running serverless functions
Correct: A
Explanation: Azure Load Balancer distributes inbound traffic across multiple virtual machines or services to improve availability and performance. It operates at layer 4 of the OSI model and can handle both internal and external traffic. Load balancing ensures no single server becomes overwhelmed while providing high availability through health probes that automatically remove failed instances from the rotation.

Question 4: Which of the following is an Azure storage account type?
A. Blob storage for unstructured data
B. File storage for SMB shares
C. Queue storage for messages
D. All of the above
Correct: D

Question 5: What does Azure Active Directory provide?
A. Virtual machine management
B. Identity and access management
C. Database administration
D. Network configuration
Correct: B
